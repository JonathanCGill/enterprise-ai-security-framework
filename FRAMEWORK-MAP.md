# Framework Map

Navigate the framework like a transit system. Each line represents a reading path. Interchanges show where topics connect.

## Reading Paths

### "I need to explain this to leadership"

Follow the **Insights** line left to right. Start with [The First Control](insights/the-first-control.md), which frames the design-thinking question. Then [Why Guardrails Aren't Enough](insights/why-guardrails-arent-enough.md) and [Humans Remain Accountable](insights/humans-remain-accountable.md) give you the business case. Skip the technical stations — come back to them when your team needs implementation detail.

After that, jump to the two **Operational Gaps** articles: [The Supply Chain Problem](insights/the-supply-chain-problem.md) and [RAG Is Your Biggest Attack Surface](insights/rag-is-your-biggest-attack-surface.md). These are the risks most boards haven't heard about yet.

### "I'm implementing controls for a new AI system"

Start on the **Getting Started** line: [Quick Start](QUICK_START.md) → [Implementation Guide](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md). These feed directly into the **Runtime Controls** line.

On the red line, work left to right: [Risk Tiers](core/risk-tiers.md) tells you which controls you actually need. [Controls](core/controls.md) is the implementation core. [Judge Assurance](core/judge-assurance.md) covers calibrating and testing your evaluation layer. [Checklist](core/checklist.md) tracks your progress.

If you're building agents, take the **Agentic** branch down from Judge: [Agentic](core/agentic.md) → [Multi-Agent Controls](core/multi-agent-controls.md) → [NHI Lifecycle](extensions/technical/nhi-lifecycle.md).

### "I'm an architect designing the pipeline"

Follow the **Emerging Challenges** line to find which challenges affect your architecture:

- Deploying multimodal? → [Multimodal Breaks Guardrails](insights/multimodal-breaks-guardrails.md) → [Multimodal Controls](core/multimodal-controls.md)
- Using reasoning models? → [When AI Thinks](insights/when-ai-thinks.md) → [Reasoning Model Controls](core/reasoning-model-controls.md)
- Building agents? → [When Agents Talk to Agents](insights/when-agents-talk-to-agents.md) → [Multi-Agent Controls](core/multi-agent-controls.md)
- Streaming responses? → [Can't Validate What Hasn't Finished](insights/you-cant-validate-unfinished.md) → [Streaming Controls](core/streaming-controls.md)

Then drop to the **Pipeline & Data** line for the data-layer controls: [RAG Security](extensions/technical/rag-security.md), [Supply Chain](extensions/technical/supply-chain.md), [Memory & Context](core/memory-and-context.md).

### "I run a SOC and need to operationalise AI monitoring"

Start with [Behavioral Anomaly Detection](insights/behavioral-anomaly-detection.md) on the green line — it explains what you're looking for and why traditional detection logic doesn't apply.

Then go straight to the **Operations** line: [SOC Integration](extensions/technical/soc-integration.md) gives you alert taxonomy, SIEM rules, and triage procedures. [Anomaly Detection Ops](extensions/technical/anomaly-detection-ops.md) covers baselining and detection engineering. [Cost & Latency](extensions/technical/cost-and-latency.md) helps you budget the evaluation layer without blowing your inference costs.

### "I need regulatory alignment"

Follow the **Regulatory** line: [ISO 42001 Mapping](extensions/regulatory) and [EU AI Act](extensions/regulatory) connect back to the [Checklist](core/checklist.md) on the red line, showing which controls satisfy which requirements.

### "I need to test and red team AI controls"

Follow the **Testing & Assurance** loop. It branches off Risk Tiers on the red line and runs down the left side of the map:

[Threat Model Template](extensions/templates/threat-model-template.md) gives you the starting structure. [Testing Guidance](extensions/templates/testing-guidance.md) covers what to test and how. From there, design adversarial tests that target your guardrails, judge, and human oversight layer specifically — the feedback loop arrow shows results flowing back into Judge Assurance and Guardrails for continuous improvement.

The loop is deliberate: testing isn't a one-off pre-deployment gate. It's a continuous cycle that runs alongside production monitoring.

## How the Map Works

The map uses London Underground visual conventions:

- **Stations** (white circles) are individual documents
- **Interchanges** (larger circles with black borders) are documents where multiple themes connect — Risk Tiers, Guardrails, Judge, Human Oversight, and Checklist are all interchanges
- **Dashed lines** show where an insight article connects to its corresponding solution document
- **The river** (pale blue band labelled DATA FLOW) separates the understanding/implementation zone above from the operational zone below
- **Red NEW badges** mark content added in the latest release
- **The pink testing loop** on the left side shows the continuous adversarial testing cycle — results feed back into Guardrails and Judge Assurance via the dashed feedback arrow
- **Grey branch lines** are extensions — supplementary material you can follow if needed

The three zone labels across the top — UNDERSTAND, IMPLEMENT, OPERATE — describe the journey left to right. Most readers won't traverse every line. Pick the line that matches your role, follow it, and branch when the map shows a connection to something relevant.
