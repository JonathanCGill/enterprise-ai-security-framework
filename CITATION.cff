abstract: >-
  A practical, open-source framework for implementing runtime behavioral
  security controls across generative and agentic AI systems. Defines a
  three-layer architecture — guardrails, LLM-as-Judge evaluation, and
  human oversight — with risk-tiered implementation guidance, regulatory
  mapping, and worked examples.
