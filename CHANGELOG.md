# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Cost model with production data
- Platform-specific implementation guides (detailed)
- Case studies from production deployments
- Judge accuracy benchmarks from real deployments
- Epistemic risk detection algorithm specifications

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **MATURITY.md** — Honest assessment of framework validation status
  - Four-level validation model (production, incident, standards, pattern consistency)
  - Explicit documentation of known gaps
  - Call for pilot partners and peer review
- **VALIDATED-AGAINST.md** — Control-by-control incident validation
  - 32 controls mapped to 10 real-world incidents
  - Evidence strength ratings (Strong: 3+ incidents, Moderate: 1–2, Threat-modelled: 0)
  - Validation coverage map by MASO domain
  - Top 5 most-validated controls identified
- **EVOLUTION.md** — Narrative history of framework development
  - Decision rationale for every major version
  - What drove each change (incidents, feedback, architectural shifts)
  - Timeline from v0.1.0 (Dec 2025) through current

### Changed
- Updated site navigation to include Credibility section (Maturity, Validated Against, Evolution)
- Changelog now links to narrative Evolution page for context

### Rationale
The framework is comprehensive but has no production deployments. Rather than ignoring this gap, these additions address it directly: honest status assessment, evidence-based validation against real incidents, and a living record of how the framework evolves in response to real-world events. Credibility comes from transparency, not claims.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- **Renamed: AI Security Blueprint → Enterprise AI Security Framework**
  - Better reflects the content scope (governance, compliance, org structure)
  - "Blueprint" implied buildable artifacts; "Framework" is accurate
  - Later renamed to **AI Runtime Behaviour Security** (February 2026)
  
### Added
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** — New practical guide with working code
  - Input guardrails (regex + Bedrock + NeMo examples)
  - Output guardrails (PII, forbidden phrases, structured validation)
  - LLM-as-Judge (prompts, sampling strategies, async processing)
  - Human-in-the-loop queue (Redis implementation, FastAPI endpoints)
  - Telemetry and logging (structured logs, Prometheus metrics)
  - Complete request flow example
  - Test suite templates (unit tests, red team inputs)
  - ~1,500 lines of copy-paste-ready Python

### Rationale
Reality check revealed the framework was thought leadership, not a buildable blueprint. Now there are two clear paths:
- **Implementors**: Start with IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (code)
- **Architects/Governance**: Use the full Framework (strategy)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-07

### Changed
- **Major restructure: Core + Extensions model**
- New `/core/` folder with 5 essential documents:
  - README.md — Overview and quick start
  - risk-tiers.md — Classification and control selection
  - controls.md — Guardrails, Judge, HITL combined
  - agentic.md — Agent-specific controls
  - checklist.md — Implementation tracking
- New `/extensions/` folder for reference material:
  - regulatory/ — ISO 42001, EU AI Act, banking
  - technical/ — Bypass prevention, infrastructure, metrics
  - templates/ — Playbooks, assessments
  - examples/ — Worked examples
- Root README now serves as navigation hub
- Previous detailed documents preserved in extensions

### Rationale
Framework had grown to 48 files. Core + Extensions model provides clear "start here" path (5 docs) while preserving depth for those who need it.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- Bypass Prevention document — comprehensive guide to preventing and detecting control circumvention across 5 bypass categories (guardrails, intent, agentic, architectural, process)
- Technical Controls document — network, firewall, WAF, AI gateway, DLP, proxy, endpoint, cloud, and IAM controls for infrastructure-level enforcement
- 14 new SVG diagrams:
  - bypass-taxonomy.svg — 5 bypass categories visual
  - defence-in-depth.svg — 8-layer control stack
  - technical-controls-architecture.svg — infrastructure overview
  - ai-gateway-architecture.svg — gateway internals
  - network-zones.svg — network segmentation
  - agent-sandbox.svg — infrastructure constraints
  - action-validator-flow.svg — action validation pipeline
  - tool-output-sanitiser.svg — tool output handling
  - canary-testing.svg — control verification programme
  - dlp-inspection-points.svg — 4 DLP layers
  - casb-ai-classification.svg — sanctioned/tolerated/blocked apps
  - bypass-learning-loop.svg — continuous improvement cycle
  - infra-vs-instruction.svg — enforcement comparison
  - multi-layer-input-validation.svg — input processing pipeline

### Changed
- Updated bypass-prevention.md and technical-controls.md to reference SVG diagrams instead of ASCII art
- Clarified lifecycle scope in README — framework is operationally focused (deployment → operation → incident response), not full AI/ML lifecycle

---
