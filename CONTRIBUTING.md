| **Production experience** | Real-world implementation lessons, cost data, failure modes |
| **Regulatory insight** | Regulatory feedback, compliance interpretations, examination findings |
| **Platform expertise** | Implementation guides for specific platforms |
| **Academic research** | Empirical validation, formal analysis |
| **Corrections** | Factual errors, outdated information, broken links |

**Also welcome:**

- Clarifications and improved explanations

## Style Guide

### Writing Style

- **Clear and direct** — Avoid jargon where possible
- **Practical** — Focus on what practitioners need
- **Honest** — Distinguish between proven and theoretical
- **Consistent** — Match the tone of existing content

### Markdown Conventions

```markdown
# Document Title (H1 - one per document)

## Major Section (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

**Bold** for emphasis on key terms
*Italic* for introducing new concepts
`Code` for technical terms, control IDs, file names

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data | Data |

- Bullet lists for unordered items
1. Numbered lists for sequences

> Blockquotes for important callouts
```

### Control Naming

- General AI controls: `AI.x.x` (e.g., AI.7.1 Input Guardrails)
- Agentic controls: `AG.x.x` (e.g., AG.2.2 Circuit Breakers)
- Always include the control name after the ID

### File Naming

- Lowercase with hyphens: `my-document-name.md`
- Numbered prefixes for ordered content: `01-introduction.md`
- SVG for diagrams: `diagram-name.svg`

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks** — Links, markdown formatting
2. **Maintainer review** — Content accuracy, style consistency
3. **Feedback** — We may request changes or clarification
4. **Merge** — Once approved, your contribution will be merged
