- [ ] False positive rate acceptable
- [ ] Latency acceptable

---

## Phase 4: Judge

### Setup
- [ ] Judge prompt developed
- [ ] Evaluation criteria defined
- [ ] Scoring rubric documented
- [ ] Judge model selected

### Shadow Mode
- [ ] Judge running on all/sampled interactions
- [ ] Findings logged but not acted on
- [ ] Human comparison performed
- [ ] Accuracy measured (target: >90%)

### Calibration
- [ ] False positive rate measured
- [ ] False negative rate estimated
- [ ] Judge prompt tuned based on findings
- [ ] Re-validated after tuning

---

## Phase 5: Human Oversight

### Queues
- [ ] Queue structure defined

- [ ] Feedback loop to Judge established

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Canary cases configured
- [ ] Review time tracking enabled
- [ ] Volume limits set
- [ ] Inter-rater reliability measured

---

## Phase 6: Operationalise

### Judge to Advisory
- [ ] Findings surfaced to reviewers
- [ ] Reviewer feedback captured
- [ ] Judge accuracy re-measured
- [ ] Tuning based on feedback

### Judge to Operational

---

## Phase 7: Continuous Improvement

### Metrics
- [ ] Guardrail block rate tracked
- [ ] Judge finding rate tracked

### Review
- [ ] Quarterly control effectiveness review
- [ ] Annual risk tier re-assessment
- [ ] Incident lessons incorporated
- [ ] Regulatory changes assessed

---

## Agent-Specific (if applicable)

### Scope Enforcement
