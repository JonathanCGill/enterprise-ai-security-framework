# AI Runtime Security

## AI systems don't just have vulnerabilities. They have behaviors.

**A practical, open-source framework for securing AI systems at runtime — where prompt injection, model manipulation, and agent drift actually happen.**

Most AI security guidance stops at the model layer. This framework addresses what happens after deployment: how AI systems behave in production, how that behavior is monitored, and how it's contained when things go wrong. Built from 20+ years of enterprise cybersecurity experience in regulated financial services.

## The Problem You're Solving

You can't fully test an AI system before deployment. The input space is natural language — effectively infinite. Emergent behavior can't be predicted through conventional test suites. And adversarial inputs will find edge cases no QA team imagined.

So how do you know it's working correctly in production?

Most enterprise "AI security" today is guardrails: input/output filters that block known-bad patterns. That catches what you can define in advance. It doesn't catch the response that's fluent, confident, and wrong. The recommendation based on hallucinated data. The action that's technically authorised but contextually dangerous.

**You need layered runtime controls — not just faster pattern matching.**

## The Architecture

The industry is converging on the same answer independently. NVIDIA NeMo, AWS Bedrock, Azure AI, LangChain, Guardrails AI — all implement variants of the same pattern:

| Layer | What It Does | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Guardrails** | Block known-bad inputs and outputs — PII, injection patterns, policy violations | Real-time (~10ms) |
| **LLM-as-Judge** | Detect unknown-bad — an independent model evaluating whether responses are appropriate | Async (~500ms–5s) |
| **Human Oversight** | Decide genuinely ambiguous cases that automated layers can't resolve | As needed |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Stop all AI traffic and activate a safe fallback when controls themselves fail | Immediate |

**Guardrails prevent. Judge detects. Humans decide. Circuit breakers contain.**

Each layer catches what the others miss. Remove any layer and you have a gap. The framework pairs every control with a **[PACE resilience architecture](docs/PACE-RESILIENCE.md)** — Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency — so when a layer degrades, the system transitions to a predetermined safe state rather than failing silently.

## Python SDK — Implement the Framework in Code

The AIRS Python SDK turns this framework from documentation into running code. Install it, run the assessment CLI, and drop the three-layer pipeline into your application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JonathanCGill/airuntimesecurity.io.git
cd airuntimesecurity.io
pip install .
```

**Assess your deployment** — interactive risk classification with prioritized control recommendations:

```bash
airs assess
```

**Protect your AI endpoints** — three-layer pipeline in 10 lines:

```python
from airs.runtime import SecurityPipeline, GuardrailChain, RegexGuardrail
from airs.core.models import AIRequest, AIResponse

pipeline = SecurityPipeline(guardrails=GuardrailChain([RegexGuardrail()]))

request = AIRequest(input_text=user_input)
input_result = await pipeline.evaluate_input(request)           # guardrails on input
# ... call your AI model ...
response = AIResponse(request_id=request.request_id, output_text=ai_output)
output_result = await pipeline.evaluate_output(request, response)  # guardrails + judge on output
```

The SDK includes: guardrails (prompt injection, PII, content policy), LLM-as-Judge (rule-based or OpenAI-compatible), circuit breaker, PACE resilience state machine, FastAPI middleware, and 52 passing tests.

## When Agents Talk to Agents

Single-model controls assume one AI, one context window, one trust boundary. Multi-agent systems break every one of those assumptions.

When multiple LLMs collaborate, delegate, and take autonomous actions, new failure modes emerge that single-agent frameworks don't address:

- **Prompt injection propagates** across agent chains — one poisoned document becomes instructions for every downstream agent
- **Hallucinations compound** — Agent A hallucinates a claim, Agent B cites it as fact, Agent C elaborates with high confidence
- **Delegation creates transitive authority** — permissions transfer implicitly through delegation chains nobody designed
- **Failures look like success** — the most dangerous outputs are well-formatted, confident, unanimously agreed, and wrong

The **[MASO Framework](docs/maso/)** extends the foundation into multi-agent orchestration: 128 controls across 7 domains, 3 implementation tiers (supervised → managed → autonomous), full OWASP coverage for both LLM and Agentic top 10s, plus 34 emergent risks that have no OWASP equivalent — including epistemic failures like groupthink and synthetic corroboration that no other framework formally addresses.

**→ [Enter MASO](docs/maso/)**

## Strategy: From Ideas to Running Systems

Security controls answer *how to secure* AI. They don't answer *what to build*, *whether AI is the right tool*, or *whether the organisation can deliver and operate it safely*.

The **[From Strategy to Production](docs/strategy/)** section bridges this gap:

| Stage | Question | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Business Alignment](docs/strategy/business-alignment.md) | Is this worth doing? Is AI the right tool? | Business case with alternatives assessed |
| [Use Case Definition](docs/strategy/use-case-definition.md) | What exactly will it do? | Ten-question definition that feeds risk classification |
| [Risk Classification](docs/core/risk-tiers.md) | What tier? What controls? | Six-dimension scored profile with governance approval |
| [From Idea to Production](docs/strategy/idea-to-production.md) | How do we get from idea to safe operation? | Eight-stage lifecycle with gates and owners |

Three constraints strategies routinely underestimate: **[Data Reality](docs/strategy/data-reality.md)** — your data determines your strategy more than your ambition does. **[Human Factors](docs/strategy/human-factors.md)** — controls don't work if the people operating them aren't ready. **[Progression](docs/strategy/progression.md)** — moving from low to high risk takes 2–3 years; skipping steps is the most common strategic failure.

## About This Framework

<details>
<summary><strong>What it provides, what it doesn't, and how to use it</strong></summary>

<br>

**What it provides:**

- **A way of thinking about controls, not a prescription for them.** The framework describes *what* needs to be true and *why* it matters. It does not mandate a specific product, vendor, or architecture. If your existing tools already satisfy a control, you don't need new ones.
- **Help deciding where to invest.** Not every control matters equally. Risk tiers, PACE resilience levels, and the distinction between foundation and multi-agent controls exist so you can reason about priority.
- **Defence in depth as a design principle.** The layered approach exists because each layer covers gaps in the others. The question isn't "which layer do we need?" but "what happens when each layer fails?"
- **Resilience thinking for AI products.** Traditional security asks "how do we prevent bad things?" This framework also asks "what happens when prevention fails?"
- **Clarity on when tools are *not* needed.** Some controls are already handled by your existing infrastructure. The framework should help you see where you already have coverage, not convince you to buy something new.
- **An AI-specific layer, not a replacement for everything else.** This framework addresses the controls that are unique to non-deterministic AI behavior. It does not replace your existing DLP, API validation, database access controls, IAM, SIEM, secure coding practices, or incident response capabilities. Those controls still matter — arguably more than ever, because they are your safety net when AI-specific controls miss something.

**What it is not:**

- Not a certification or audit standard. You cannot be "compliant with" this framework.
- Not a product recommendation. Tool and vendor references are illustrative, not endorsements.
- Not a substitute for professional security assessment of your specific deployment.
- Not a finished document. AI security is moving fast. This framework will evolve as the landscape does.
