# AI Security Infrastructure Controls — Repo Structure

> Complements [AI Runtime Behaviour Security](https://github.com/JonathanCGill/ai-runtime-behaviour-security), which defines the *behavioral* security pattern (Guardrails → LLM-as-Judge → Human Oversight). This repo defines the *infrastructure* controls that make that pattern enforceable.

| Logging & Observability | `controls/logging-and-observability.md` | 10 | LOG-01 to LOG-10 |
| Network & Segmentation | `controls/network-and-segmentation.md` | 8 | NET-01 to NET-08 |
| Data Protection | `controls/data-protection.md` | 8 | DAT-01 to DAT-08 |
| Secrets & Credentials | `controls/secrets-and-credentials.md` | 8 | SEC-01 to SEC-08 |
| Supply Chain | `controls/supply-chain.md` | 8 | SUP-01 to SUP-08 |
| Incident Response | `controls/incident-response.md` | 8 | IR-01 to IR-08 |
| Tool Access | `agentic/tool-access-controls.md` | 6 | TOOL-01 to TOOL-06 |

| **Total** | **11 files** | **80** | |

## Design Principles

1. **Vendor-neutral first.** Platform-specific guidance lives in `reference/platform-patterns/`, never in the core control definitions.
2. **Three-layer alignment.** Every technical control maps back to how it enables or strengthens the Guardrails → Judge → Human Oversight pattern.
3. **Risk-tiered.** Controls specify which risk tiers (from the parent framework) they apply to, so implementers can right-size.
4. **Practitioner audience.** Written for security architects and engineers who will implement these controls. Not executive summaries.
5. **Agentic AI treated separately.** Agentic systems introduce trust delegation, tool invocation, and autonomous action — these deserve their own control domain.
6. **Infrastructure beats instructions.** Security controls enforced via deterministic infrastructure (gateways, network policy, vaults), never via prompt instructions.

## Implementation Sequence

| Phase | Control Domain | Rationale |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | Identity & Access | Without IAM, nothing else is enforceable |
| 2 | Logging & Observability | You can't detect what you can't see |
| 3 | Network & Segmentation | Reduce blast radius, enforce zone boundaries |
| 4 | Data Protection | PII, model I/O, context window data flows |
| 5 | Secrets & Credentials | API keys, tokens, vault patterns |
| 6 | Supply Chain | Model provenance, dependency integrity, AI-BOM |
| 7 | Incident Response | AI-specific IR extending enterprise processes |

Agentic controls (TOOL, SESS, DEL, SAND) are implemented in parallel with the relevant phase when agentic systems are in scope.

## Relationship to Parent Framework

The parent framework ([ai-runtime-behaviour-security](https://github.com/JonathanCGill/ai-runtime-behaviour-security)) defines the behavioural pattern:

- **What** to enforce (Guardrails prevent, Judge detects, Humans decide)
- **Why** it's necessary (non-determinism, emergent behaviour, adversarial inputs)
- **When** to apply controls (risk tier classification)

This repo defines:

- **How** to enforce it at the infrastructure level (80 technical controls)
- **Where** the boundaries are (network zones, identity chains, data flows)
- **Which platforms** implement it (AWS, Azure, Databricks patterns)

The parent framework answers *what*. This repo answers *how*.
