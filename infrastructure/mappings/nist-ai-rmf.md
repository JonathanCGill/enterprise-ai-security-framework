## Scope and Limitations

This mapping covers 51 subcategories across the four NIST AI RMF functions. The mapping focuses on **technical infrastructure** contributions. Many NIST AI RMF subcategories require organisational processes, policies, and governance structures that are beyond the scope of infrastructure controls. Where a subcategory is primarily organisational, the mapping identifies supporting infrastructure controls and notes the organisational gap.

## Coverage Summary

|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Govern** | 14 | IAM, logging, supply chain, incident response, network controls |
| **Map** | 12 | Supply chain, session/delegation, logging, incident response |
| **Measure** | 13 | All logging controls, data protection, supply chain, agentic controls |

| **Total** | **51** | |

**Note:** Many NIST AI RMF subcategories are primarily organisational in nature (governance structures, policy creation, stakeholder engagement, training programmes). This mapping identifies the infrastructure controls that support these subcategories technically, but organisational implementation is required for full framework alignment.
