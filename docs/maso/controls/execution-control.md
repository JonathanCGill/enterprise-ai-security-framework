## Principle

Every agent action is bounded: bounded by permission, bounded by impact, bounded by time. No single agent can cause unlimited damage. When an agent fails, the failure is contained to that agent. When errors cascade, automated circuit breakers engage before human response is required.

Execution control is where the PACE resilience methodology meets real-time operations. The controls in this domain define the triggers that move the system from Primary to Alternate and beyond.

## Why This Matters in Multi-Agent Systems

**Tool misuse compounds across agents.** In a single-model system, a tool misuse event is contained to one context. In a multi-agent system, Agent A's misuse of Tool X produces output that becomes Agent B's input for Tool Y. The damage from chained tool misuse can far exceed what any single agent could accomplish alone.

**Code execution pathways multiply.** When agents generate and execute code, each agent is a potential entry point for code injection. If Agent A generates code that Agent B executes in its sandbox, the security boundary depends on both the generation controls (Agent A) and the execution controls (Agent B). A weakness in either is exploitable.

**Cascading failures are the default, not the exception.** Multi-agent systems are tightly coupled by design - agents depend on each other's outputs. A hallucination in one agent becomes a flawed plan in the next, becomes a destructive action in the third. Without explicit isolation, errors propagate at the speed of the orchestration.

**Runaway loops consume resources exponentially.** Two agents triggering each other in a cycle can generate exponential resource consumption. The loop may look like productive work to a naive monitor - each agent is calling tools, producing outputs, and delegating tasks - but the system is burning tokens and compute on a recursive dead end.

**Single agent loss cascades through the orchestration (OP-04).** When one agent in a multi-agent system becomes unavailable - model provider outage, sandbox crash, credential revocation - every agent that depends on its output is affected. Without explicit failover, a single agent failure degrades or halts the entire orchestration. The system's availability is determined by its least available component, not its most robust.

**Irreversible actions compound across agent chains (OP-05).** Agent A sends an email. Agent B deletes a record. Agent C makes an API call to a third party. Each action was individually approved, but the chain is collectively irreversible. When Agent D detects that Agent A's email was based on hallucinated data, the downstream actions cannot be undone. Reversibility must be assessed for the chain, not just per-action, and compensating controls must exist for actions that cannot be recalled.

**Data integrity failures are silent and cumulative.** Security guardrails catch injections. Content filters catch harmful output. But when Agent A returns a JSON object with a missing field and Agent B silently treats that field as `null`, the resulting action is wrong - not malicious, just wrong. In production multi-agent systems, the majority of runtime failures come not from security violations but from structural data integrity failures between components: malformed tool outputs, unexpected types, truncated responses, hallucinated field names, and partial results presented as complete. These failures are harder to detect than security violations because they don't trigger guardrails - the output is syntactically valid but semantically broken.

## Controls by Tier

### Tier 1 - Supervised

| Control | Requirement | Implementation Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **EC-1.1** Human approval gate | Every write operation, external API call, and state-modifying action requires human approval | System presents proposed action (tool, parameters, target) and waits for confirmation. |
| **EC-1.2** Tool allow-lists | Each agent has a defined list of permitted tools; unlisted tools are blocked | Enforced at the guardrails layer. |
| **EC-1.3** Per-agent rate limits | Maximum actions per time window per agent | Prevents runaway loops before human review catches them. Recommended: 100 calls/hr. |
| **EC-1.4** Read auto-approval | Read operations within scoped permissions proceed without human approval | Establishes the efficiency baseline that Tier 2 will extend. |
| **EC-1.5** Interaction timeout | All agent negotiation sequences have a maximum turn count | Recommended: 10 turns. Exceeding cap triggers deterministic resolution (orchestrator decides or task escalates to human). Prevents deadlock and livelock (CR-01). |
| **EC-1.5a** Agent spawn rate limit | Maximum number of new agent instances the orchestrator can create per time window | Prevents runaway spawning that exhausts compute, memory, or API quota. Recommended: define per-orchestration and per-time-window limits. Exceeding the spawn rate limit blocks new agent creation and triggers an alert. |
| **EC-1.6** Reversibility assessment | Every action is classified as reversible, time-bounded reversible, or irreversible before execution | Irreversible actions require human approval (reinforces EC-1.1). Time-bounded reversible actions carry a reversal window (e.g., "email can be recalled within 60 seconds"). Classification is logged with each action (OP-05). |
| **EC-1.7** Agent health check | Each agent's availability is verified before task assignment | Orchestrator confirms agent is responsive before delegating. If unavailable, task is queued or routed to an alternative. Prevents silent failure from assigning work to a dead agent (OP-04). |
| **EC-1.8** Output format verification | Agent outputs checked against expected format before delivery to the next component or human reviewer | Basic validation: is the response valid JSON if JSON was expected? Are required top-level fields present? Is the response non-empty? Malformed outputs are rejected and the task retried or escalated - not silently passed downstream. |

### Tier 2 - Managed

All Tier 1 controls remain active, plus:

| Control | Requirement | Implementation Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **EC-2.1** Action classification | Every action classified as auto-approve, escalate, or block | Classification considers: action type, target system, data classification, agent history, LLM-as-Judge evaluation. |
| **EC-2.2** Sandboxed execution | Agents generating/executing code operate in isolated environments | Per-agent sandbox with defined filesystem, network, and process boundaries. Sandbox destroyed and recreated after each execution. |
| **EC-2.3** Blast radius caps | Maximum impact scope per agent | Max records modifiable, max financial value, max external API calls. Exceeding any cap triggers PACE escalation. |
| **EC-2.4** Circuit breakers | Agent paused on error threshold | E.g., 3 guardrail blocks in 10 minutes triggers circuit breaker. Agent is paused, event is logged, monitoring evaluates next step. |
| **EC-2.5** LLM-as-Judge gate | Evaluation model reviews all agent outputs before external commit | Evaluates: factual accuracy, policy compliance, goal integrity (cross-ref [PG-2.2](prompt-goal-and-epistemic-integrity.md)), output safety, data leakage. Judge criteria include faithfulness and analytical depth, not just format compliance (GV-02). |
| **EC-2.6** Decision commit protocol | Decisions passing judge review are committed; reversal requires human authorisation or documented input change | Prevents oscillation (CR-02). Tie-break rules defined for equal-weight alternatives. |
| **EC-2.7** Aggregate harm assessment | Judge evaluation includes full task plan context, not just individual agent output | For multi-step plans, judge evaluates the whole plan before execution begins. Catches cumulative harm from individually benign subtasks (SM-01). |
| **EC-2.7a** Dry-run / simulation mode | High-risk or first-time actions execute against a sandbox or staging environment before production commit | The gateway routes the action to a simulation target, captures the result, and presents it for human review or Judge evaluation. Only after validation does the action execute against production. Mandatory for irreversible actions in new deployments where no behavioral baseline exists. |
| **EC-2.8** Tool completion attestation | Required tool calls defined per task; tool failure or skip produces explicit incomplete status | Judge verifies all required tools completed before approving output. Prevents partial failure masquerading as success (OP-03). |
| **EC-2.9** Latency SLOs and oversight SLA enforcement | Per-orchestration end-to-end latency targets defined and monitored; maximum time before human review required is enforced per risk tier | Documents which control layers operate synchronously (blocking) vs asynchronously (post-commit audit). Judge may run async for auto-approved actions to reduce latency. For escalated actions, a configurable oversight SLA defines the maximum wait time for human review; actions not reviewed within the SLA window fail safe (denied, not auto-approved). |
| **EC-2.10** Agent failover | Critical agents have a defined failover path: backup agent, graceful degradation, or controlled halt | Failover activates automatically on health check failure (EC-1.7). Backup agents operate with the same NHI scope and tool allow-list as the primary. Orchestration continues in degraded mode if non-critical agents are unavailable; halts if critical agents are unavailable with no backup (OP-04). |
| **EC-2.11** Chain reversibility assessment | For multi-step plans, the Judge evaluates aggregate reversibility before execution begins | If the plan contains irreversible actions, the Judge flags the irreversibility point and requires explicit human acknowledgement. Compensating actions must be defined for each irreversible step (e.g., correction email, reversal transaction, notification to affected party) (OP-05). |
| **EC-2.12** Multimodal boundary validation | When multimodal data (images, audio, video, documents) crosses an agent boundary, modality-specific guardrails are applied at the receiving agent | Text-in-image injection, steganographic payloads, inaudible audio commands, and embedded document instructions are checked at each agent boundary, not just at system input. Cross-ref [Multimodal Controls](../../core/multimodal-controls.md). |
| **EC-2.13** Output schema enforcement | Every agent declares the schema of its output; outputs are validated against this schema before delivery | JSON Schema, Pydantic models, or equivalent. Validation checks: required fields present, types correct, enums within allowed values, string lengths within bounds, nested structures conform. Schema failures produce a structured error - not a silent pass with missing fields. Schemas are versioned and published in the agent manifest alongside tool declarations. |
| **EC-2.14** Inter-agent data contracts | Every agent-to-agent data transfer is validated against a declared contract at the receiving agent's boundary | The contract specifies the expected input schema, required fields, acceptable value ranges, and maximum payload size. The receiving agent validates inbound data before processing - not the sending agent alone. This is the structural equivalent of zero-trust: **trust nothing, parse strictly, validate everything.** Contracts are enforced at the message bus or gateway layer, not by the agents themselves. |
| **EC-2.15** Serialisation boundary validation | Structured outputs (JSON, XML, function call arguments) are parsed with strict-mode deserialisation; no lenient parsing | Strict mode: reject unknown fields, reject type mismatches (string where number expected), reject `null` for required fields, reject malformed escape sequences. No silent coercion. Deserialised objects are validated against the output schema (EC-2.13) immediately after parsing. Path traversal patterns in string fields (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) are caught by parameter constraints, not by the parser - but the parser must not silently accept them. |

### Tier 3 - Autonomous

All Tier 2 controls remain active, plus:

| Control | Requirement | Implementation Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **EC-3.1** Infrastructure-enforced blast radius | Caps enforced at platform level, not by agent or orchestrator | Agent cannot override its own blast radius through any mechanism. Analogous to OS-level resource limits. |
| **EC-3.2** Self-healing circuit breakers | Circuit breaker triggers PACE P→A automatically; backup agent activates; system returns to P on stabilisation | Self-healing cycle limit: max 3 in 24 hours before auto-escalation to Contingency. |
| **EC-3.3** Multi-model cross-validation | High-consequence actions validated by LLM-as-Judge AND an independent second model | Disagreement between validators triggers human escalation. |
| **EC-3.4** Time-boxing | Every autonomous task has a maximum execution time | Task not completed within time box → agent paused, state captured, task escalated. Prevents indefinite autonomous operation on drifted tasks. |
| **EC-3.5** Automated rollback scope | When integrity compromise is detected, automated rollback covers the compromised agent and all downstream actions that depended on its output | Rollback scope is determined by the decision chain (OB-2.1). Downstream agents are notified. Actions that cannot be rolled back trigger compensating actions automatically. Human is notified of the rollback scope and any irreversible residual. |
| **EC-3.6** Transformation integrity chain | Data validated after each processing step in a multi-agent pipeline; cumulative integrity tracked end-to-end | Each agent in a pipeline attests to the structural validity of its output. The attestation chain travels with the data (analogous to DP-3.4 data provenance but for structural integrity). If any agent in the chain produces output that fails schema validation, downstream processing halts immediately - not after the malformed data has been transformed two more times. Integrity violations are correlated with the specific pipeline step that introduced the corruption. |

## Action Classification Rules (Tier 2+)

The action classification engine is the core mechanism that replaces per-action human approval with risk-proportionate automation. Rules should be defined collaboratively between the AI security team and the business function that owns the agent system.

**Auto-approve (no human involvement):**

- Read operations within the agent's scoped permissions
- Write operations to internal staging areas (reversible, low-consequence)
- Tool invocations within pre-approved parameter ranges
- Actions that the LLM-as-Judge approves and the blast radius cap is not at risk

**Escalate (human approval required):**

- Write operations to production systems
- Actions involving external parties (email sends, API calls to third-party services)
- Irreversible operations (data deletion, financial transactions)
- Actions flagged by the LLM-as-Judge for any reason
- Actions where the blast radius cap would exceed 50% of the defined maximum
- First-time use of a tool by an agent (no baseline data)

**Block (automatic denial):**

- Actions outside the agent's tool allow-list
- Actions that violate the guardrails layer
- Actions targeting systems not in the agent's scope
- Actions during a PACE Alternate or Contingency phase that exceed the phase-specific restrictions

## Testing Criteria

### Tier 1 Tests

| Test ID | Test | Pass Criteria |
|---------|------|---------------|
| EC-T1.1 | Approval gate | Submit a write operation. Confirm it blocks until human approval. Reject the approval and confirm the action is prevented. |
| EC-T1.2 | Tool scope | Attempt to invoke a tool not on the agent's allow-list. Guardrail blocks it. |
| EC-T1.3 | Rate limit | Submit actions exceeding the configured rate. Throttling engages. |
| EC-T1.4 | Read auto-approval | Submit a read operation within scope. Confirm it executes without human approval. |
| EC-T1.5 | Interaction timeout | Trigger a negotiation loop. Confirm the turn cap is enforced and resolution engages. |
| EC-T1.6 | Role-based tool enforcement | For each agent role (analyst, executor, critic), attempt to invoke tools assigned to a different role. All attempts blocked. (Amendment: CR-03) |
| EC-T1.7 | Operator challenge rate | Present operators with outputs containing deliberate errors. Measure challenge rate. Target: > 80% detection. (Amendment: HF-01) |
| EC-T1.8 | Reversibility classification | Submit a reversible action, a time-bounded reversible action, and an irreversible action. Verify each is classified correctly and the irreversible action requires human approval. |
| EC-T1.9 | Agent health check | Take an agent offline. Assign it a task. Verify the orchestrator detects unavailability and routes the task to an alternative or queues it. |
| EC-T1.10 | Output format verification | Agent returns malformed JSON (e.g., unclosed bracket, missing required field). Verify the output is rejected before reaching the next component or human reviewer. Retry or escalation triggered. |

### Tier 2 Tests

| Test ID | Test | Pass Criteria |
|---------|------|---------------|
| EC-T2.1 | Action classification | Submit reads, low-consequence writes, high-consequence writes, and out-of-scope actions. Each is classified correctly. |
| EC-T2.2 | Sandbox isolation | From within an agent's sandbox, attempt to access the host filesystem, network outside allowed ranges, and other agent processes. All attempts blocked. |
| EC-T2.3 | Blast radius cap | Attempt to exceed a defined blast radius cap. System blocks the excess and triggers PACE escalation. |
| EC-T2.4 | Circuit breaker | Trigger the error threshold. Agent is paused within 30 seconds. Event is logged. |
| EC-T2.5 | LLM-as-Judge detection | Submit known-bad outputs (policy violations, goal drift, data leakage). Measure judge detection rate. Target: > 95% for HIGH severity, > 80% for MEDIUM. |
| EC-T2.6 | Interaction timeout | Trigger a negotiation loop between two agents exceeding the turn cap. Deterministic resolution engages. |
| EC-T2.7 | Decision oscillation | Two agents reverse a decision 3 times. Decision commit protocol detects oscillation and locks the decision or escalates. |

| EC-T2.11 | Agent failover | Take a critical agent offline. Verify backup agent activates and the orchestration continues in degraded mode. Verify a non-critical agent failure allows the orchestration to complete without the missing agent. |
| EC-T2.12 | Chain reversibility | Submit a multi-step plan containing an irreversible action at step 3 of 5. Judge flags the irreversibility point before execution begins and requires human acknowledgement. |
| EC-T2.13 | Multimodal boundary | Send an image containing text-in-image injection from Agent A to Agent B. Verify Agent B's boundary guardrails detect the injection before processing. |
| EC-T2.14 | Output schema enforcement | Agent produces output missing a required field. Verify schema validation catches the violation before delivery. Agent produces output with a wrong type (string where integer expected). Verify rejection. Agent produces valid output conforming to schema. Verify acceptance. |

| EC-T3.4 | Cross-validation disagreement | Submit an action where one validator approves and the other rejects. Confirm human escalation. |
| EC-T3.5 | Time-box expiry | Start a task with a tight time box. Let it expire. Confirm pause, state capture, and escalation. |
| EC-T3.6 | Automated rollback scope | Inject a hallucination at Agent A that propagates to Agents B and C. Trigger integrity detection. Verify automated rollback covers Agent A's action and all downstream work from B and C. Verify irreversible residual is reported to the human. |
| EC-T3.7 | Transformation integrity chain | In a three-agent pipeline (A → B → C), Agent B produces output with a schema violation. Verify: (a) Agent C does not receive the malformed data, (b) the violation is attributed to Agent B's processing step specifically, (c) the integrity chain log identifies the exact point of corruption. |

## Common Pitfalls

**Blast radius caps that are too generous.** A cap of "10,000 records per hour" for an agent that normally modifies 50 records per hour is not a cap - it's a ceiling so high it provides no protection. Caps should be set at 2–3x the expected peak volume, not at theoretical maximums.

**Circuit breakers that only count errors.** An agent that never triggers guardrails but produces subtly incorrect output is more dangerous than one that fails loudly. Circuit breakers should include quality metrics (LLM-as-Judge scores) not just error counts.

**Sandboxes with network access.** A sandbox that isolates the filesystem but allows unrestricted network access is not a sandbox - it's a launchpad. Network scope should be limited to the specific endpoints the agent's tools require.

**Conflating the LLM-as-Judge with the task agent.** The judge must be independent - a different model, ideally from a different provider, with no access to the task agent's system prompt or configuration. If the judge uses the same model as the task agent, they share the same blindspots.

**Evaluating individual steps but not the aggregate plan.** Each subtask passes guardrails and the judge. But the combined effect is harmful - a planning agent has decomposed a harmful objective into individually benign steps. The judge must evaluate multi-step plans holistically (EC-2.7), not just step by step.

**Treating task completion as the quality metric.** An agent that reports 100% completion with zero uncertainty is more suspicious than one that reports 85% with documented unknowns. Judge criteria must include faithfulness, analytical depth, and evidence quality - not just format compliance and completion rate (GV-02).

**Ignoring latency as a security-relevant metric.** Latency SLOs are not just a performance concern. An orchestration that takes 10x longer than expected may indicate a runaway loop, a deadlock, or an agent being manipulated into excessive processing. Latency monitoring feeds into anomaly detection.

**Assessing reversibility per-action but not per-chain.** Each action in a multi-step plan is individually approved, but the aggregate chain may be irreversible. Agent A sends an email (reversible within 60 seconds), Agent B updates a record (reversible), Agent C notifies an external party (irreversible). By the time Agent C acts, the 60-second window on Agent A's email has closed. The chain's reversibility decays over time and must be assessed as a whole before execution begins.

**No failover for the agent everyone depends on.** The most critical agent in the orchestration is often the one with no backup - because it was deployed as a singleton and nobody defined what happens when it's unavailable. Agent criticality should be assessed at design time, and critical agents must have a failover path: backup agent, graceful degradation, or controlled halt. "The orchestration waits indefinitely" is not a failover strategy.

**Applying text guardrails to multimodal inter-agent data.** When an image, audio file, or document crosses an agent boundary, text-based DLP and injection detection are insufficient. Each modality requires modality-specific validation at the receiving agent's boundary - not just at the system's external input layer.

**Validating content safety but not data structure.** Guardrails catch prompt injection and PII. The LLM-as-Judge catches policy violations and goal drift. But neither catches a model output that returns `{"status": "complete", "result": null}` when downstream agents expect `result` to be a non-empty object. Structural validation - schema conformance, type correctness, field completeness - is a distinct concern from content safety and must be enforced separately at every agent boundary. Without it, parsing failures, type coercion bugs, and silent data corruption become the dominant failure mode in production multi-agent systems.

**Treating serialisation as a solved problem.** When an agent returns structured output (JSON, XML, function call arguments), the output is a string that must be parsed. Strict-mode parsing should be the default. Lenient parsers that silently coerce types, accept trailing commas, or ignore extra fields mask data integrity failures and can introduce injection vectors when untrusted content is deserialised into executable structures.
