# AI Governance Operating Model — ISO 42001 Alignment

This document defines how a centralised AI governance function operates in alignment with ISO 42001:2023 (AI Management System) while leveraging the control framework (guardrails, Judge, HITL) and enterprise AI platforms.

---

## Executive Summary

ISO 42001 establishes requirements for an **AI Management System (AIMS)**—a structured approach to governing AI across the organisation. This document maps:

1. **ISO 42001 clauses** → Framework controls
2. **Centralised governance function** → Roles, responsibilities, processes
3. **Platform capabilities** → Technical implementation (Bedrock, Databricks, Foundry)
4. **Operating rhythm** → Governance cadence and decision rights

**Core principle:** Centralised policy, federated execution, unified assurance.

---

## ISO 42001 Structure Overview

ISO 42001 follows the Annex SL high-level structure common to all ISO management systems:

![ISO 42001 PDCA Cycle](../../images/iso-42001-pdca.svg)

| Clause | Title | Focus |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 4 | Context of the organisation | Understand internal/external factors affecting AI |
| 5 | Leadership | Management commitment and policy |
| 6 | Planning | Risk assessment and objectives |
| 7 | Support | Resources, competence, awareness, communication |
| 8 | Operation | AI system lifecycle controls |
| 9 | Performance evaluation | Monitoring, measurement, audit, review |
| 10 | Improvement | Nonconformity, corrective action, continual improvement |

**Annex A** provides AI-specific controls (similar to ISO 27001 Annex A for information security).

## Governance Operating Model

![AI Governance Operating Model](../../images/ai-governance-operating-model.svg)

### Three Lines Model for AI

| Line | Function | AI Governance Role |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **1st Line** | Business / Engineering | Build and operate AI systems; execute controls |
| **2nd Line** | AI Governance / Risk | Set policy; provide oversight; operate assurance |
| **3rd Line** | Internal Audit | Independent assurance; validate effectiveness |

### Centralised vs Federated

| Aspect | Centralised (AI Governance Function) | Federated (Business Units) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Policy | ✅ Sets AI policy and standards | Implements policy |
| Risk framework | ✅ Defines risk tiers and methodology | Performs risk assessments |
| Control standards | ✅ Defines control requirements | Implements controls |
| Tooling/platforms | ✅ Selects and governs platforms | Uses platforms |
| Judge configuration | ✅ Defines evaluation criteria | May customise for use case |
| HITL processes | ✅ Defines requirements | Staffs and operates |
| Monitoring | ✅ Aggregates and reports | Monitors own systems |
| Approval (CRITICAL) | ✅ Approves CRITICAL deployments | Requests approval |
| Approval (HIGH) | Reviews | ✅ Approves with risk sign-off |
| Approval (MEDIUM/LOW) | Spot checks | ✅ Self-service with standards |
