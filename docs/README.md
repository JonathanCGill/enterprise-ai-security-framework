# AI Runtime Security

**AI Governance decides what AI should do. AI Runtime Security verifies what it actually does.**

These are different questions, different tools, and different teams. Governance sets policy: what the model is allowed to do, who is accountable, what regulations apply. Runtime security enforces it: catching the prompt injection mid-request, evaluating outputs before they reach users, halting the agent that tries to exceed its scope.

Most organisations have governance. Few have runtime security. That gap is where the failures live.

AIRS is a vendor-neutral, risk-proportionate framework for the enforcement side: layered runtime controls you can match to your actual risk, not a compliance checklist.

**Three domains, one framework.** [Foundation](foundations/README.md) secures single-agent systems, [MASO](maso/README.md) secures multi-agent orchestration, and [Infrastructure](infrastructure/README.md) secures the platforms underneath. The [SDK](sdk/README.md) turns all three into code.

## The governance gap

<div class="governance-split" markdown>
<div class="governance-col" markdown>

**Governance asks:**

What is this AI allowed to do? Who is accountable when it fails? Does this deployment comply with policy and regulation?

*Answered by: policies, risk registers, accountability frameworks, audits, and compliance programmes.*

</div>
<div class="runtime-col" markdown>

**Runtime security answers:**

Is it doing that, right now, in this request? Did the model stay in scope? What stopped the last injection?

*Answered by: guardrails, model evaluation, audit trails, human escalation paths, and circuit breakers.*

</div>
</div>

Governance without runtime security is intent without enforcement. Your policy says the model should not exfiltrate data. Runtime security is what actually stops it.

## Three Questions. Three Doors.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **How do I run AI securely?**

    Ship your first LLM feature with the controls that matter most. Seven controls, one checklist, one decision tree for whether you need to go deeper.

    [Start](start.md) · [AIRSLite](minimum-viable-airs.md) · [Quick Start](quick-start.md)

-   **How do I secure AI while it is running?**

    The framework itself: four independent control layers for single-agent systems, ten control domains for multi-agent orchestration, PACE resilience for graceful degradation.

    [Core Controls](core/README.md) · [MASO](maso/README.md) · [Architecture](architecture.md)

-   **How do I get the most out of AI safely?**

    Role-specific entry points. Each page tells you what matters for your role, why, where to start reading, and what you can do on Monday morning.

    [For Your Role](stakeholders/README.md)

## Find Your Role

Nine role-specific entry points. Each one frames AI runtime security through the lens of a single job, with a starting path, Monday-morning actions, and answers to the pushback you will get.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **[Security Leaders](stakeholders/security-leaders.md)**

    *How do I secure AI when the threat model is unlike anything I've secured before?*

-   **[Risk & Governance](stakeholders/risk-and-governance.md)**

    *How do I quantify AI risk and prove to the board that controls are working?*

-   **[Compliance & Legal](stakeholders/compliance-and-legal.md)**

    *How do I demonstrate that AI deployments meet regulatory obligations, with evidence?*

-   **[Insider Threat Teams](stakeholders/insider-threat-teams.md)**

    *Your programme already solves the problem AI agents create. How do you extend it?*

-   **[Chief Information Officers](stakeholders/chief-information-officers.md)**

    *How do I govern AI across my technology portfolio when every product runs different agents?*

-   **[Enterprise Architects](stakeholders/enterprise-architects.md)**

    *Where do controls go in my pipeline, what do they cost, and how do they fail?*

-   **[AI Engineers](stakeholders/ai-engineers.md)**

    *What do I actually build? Give me implementation patterns, not governance theory.*

-   **[Business Owners](stakeholders/business-owners.md)**

    *How do I manage AI risk across my product lines when agents are operational?*

-   **[Product Owners](stakeholders/product-owners.md)**

    *What controls are required to ship AI, and what do they cost in time and money?*

</div>

| **Implementation** | Platform patterns for AWS, Azure, Databricks. Tool access controls. Agentic infrastructure. | [Infrastructure](infrastructure/README.md) |
| **SDK** | Python reference implementation. Guardrails, judge evaluation, circuit breakers in code. | [SDK](sdk/README.md) |

## Four Control Layers

A runtime control plane for AI behaviour. Each layer operates independently, and each can run in **detect-only** mode before you graduate it to **enforcing**. No single failure compromises the system.

<div class="control-layers" markdown>
<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **Guardrails**

    Fast, deterministic boundaries: content policies, scope constraints, tool-use permissions. Catches the obvious failures at machine speed. *~10ms per check.*

-   **Model-as-Judge**

    A separate model evaluates outputs against policy, context, and intent before they reach users. Catches the subtle failures guardrails miss. *~500ms to 5s, sync or async by risk tier.*

-   **Human Oversight**

    Escalation paths, audit trails, and intervention capability for high-stakes decisions. Scope scales with consequence.

-   **Circuit Breakers**

    Emergency failsafes that halt AI operations and activate safe fallbacks when controls fail or compromise is confirmed.
