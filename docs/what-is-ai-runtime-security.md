# What is AI Runtime Security?

**AI Runtime Security (AI-RS)** is the discipline of controlling and observing AI system behaviour during live operation, rather than relying solely on design-time testing or model evaluation.

It addresses a gap that existing security disciplines do not cover: the period between deployment and decommission, when AI systems interact with real users, real data, and real business processes — and when their behaviour can diverge from what was tested, expected, or authorised.

## Definition

> AI Runtime Security is the practice of monitoring, constraining, and governing AI system behaviour in production environments. It applies defence-in-depth principles at the point of execution, treating deployment as the beginning of the risk lifecycle rather than the end of it.

## Scope

AI Runtime Security covers the operational phase of AI systems. It is concerned with what AI systems actually do, not what they were designed to do.

| In scope | Out of scope |
|----------|-------------|
| Runtime behavioural controls | Model training and fine-tuning |
| Production monitoring and observability | Pre-deployment red-teaming (as standalone) |
| Automated evaluation of live outputs | Dataset curation and provenance |
| Human oversight and escalation | Model architecture selection |
| Incident response for AI-specific failures | Prompt engineering best practices |
| Multi-agent coordination security | AI ethics and fairness (as standalone) |
| Regulatory evidence from live operation | Theoretical alignment research |

This does not mean pre-deployment activities are unimportant. They are necessary but insufficient. A model that passed every evaluation can still hallucinate a regulatory disclosure, leak PII through a tool call, or take an action in an agent chain that no human authorised.

## Core Controls

AI Runtime Security is built on layered, independent controls that compensate for each other's weaknesses:

**Guardrails** — fast, deterministic boundaries that enforce content policies, scope constraints, and tool-use permissions at the point of execution.

**LLM-as-Judge** — an independent model that evaluates the primary model's outputs against policy, context, and intent before those outputs reach users or downstream systems.

**Human Oversight** — structured escalation paths, audit trails, and intervention capability for high-risk decisions and anomaly-triggered review.

**Circuit Breakers** — emergency failsafes that halt AI operations and activate safe fallbacks when controls themselves fail or when confirmed compromise is detected.

Each layer operates independently. No single failure compromises the system.

## Relationship to Existing Security Domains

AI Runtime Security does not replace existing security disciplines. It extends them into a domain they were not designed to cover.

| Existing discipline | What it secures | Where AI-RS extends it |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Application Security | Code, APIs, web applications | AI-specific input/output validation, prompt injection defence |
| Network Security | Traffic, segmentation, perimeters | Agent-to-agent communication, tool-call routing |
| Identity & Access | Users, roles, permissions | Per-agent identity, delegation chains, transitive authority |
| Data Protection | Storage, transit, classification | Context window leakage, cross-agent data flow, RAG poisoning |
| Incident Response | Detection, containment, recovery | AI-specific failure modes, PACE resilience, circuit breaker activation |
| Security Operations | Monitoring, alerting, investigation | AI behavioural telemetry, judge evaluation pipelines, drift detection |

The principle is not new. Defence-in-depth has always been how we secure complex systems. What is new is applying it systematically to AI runtime behaviour — where the system's outputs are non-deterministic, context-dependent, and capable of autonomous action.

## Why a Discipline, Not Just a Framework

Frameworks get copied. Categories get cited.

AI Runtime Security is not a single product, vendor capability, or proprietary methodology. It is a field of practice that any organisation deploying AI systems in production needs to address.

The [AI-RS Framework](ARCHITECTURE.md) is a reference architecture for this discipline — one implementation model that provides controls, patterns, and operational guidance. But the discipline itself is broader than any single framework. It encompasses:

- The [Foundation Framework](foundations/) for single-agent deployments (80+ controls)
- [Multi-Agent Security Operations (MASO)](maso/) for autonomous agent coordination (128 controls)
- [Regulatory alignment](extensions/regulatory/eu-ai-act-crosswalk.md) with EU AI Act, ISO 42001, and NIST AI RMF
- [Platform-specific patterns](infrastructure/reference/platform-patterns/aws-bedrock.md) for AWS, Azure, and Databricks
- An [open-source SDK](sdk/) for runtime control implementation

As AI systems grow more autonomous, the need for structured runtime security will only increase. The question is not whether organisations need AI Runtime Security. It is whether they implement it before or after the first production incident forces them to.

## Standards Alignment

AI Runtime Security maps to established regulatory and standards frameworks:

- **EU AI Act** — Article 9 (risk management), Article 14 (human oversight), Article 15 (accuracy and robustness)
- **NIST AI RMF** — GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE functions
- **ISO 42001** — Annex A controls for AI management systems
- **OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025)** — full coverage across runtime control layers
- **OWASP Agentic Top 10 (2026)** — multi-agent specific controls via MASO
