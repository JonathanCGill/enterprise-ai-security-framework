# AIRS Python SDK

**Turn the framework into running code.**

The AIRS Python SDK implements the three-layer security architecture as a drop-in library for Python AI applications. Instead of reading about controls, you can `pip install` them. Like the framework itself, the SDK is designed to be risk-proportionate: use the components you need for your risk tier, leave out the ones you do not.

## Bring Your Own Model

The SDK is **model-agnostic**. It does not call AI models for you. It wraps security controls *around* your existing model calls. You continue using whatever model, provider, or framework you already have:

```python
# 1. AIRS checks the input
input_result = await pipeline.evaluate_input(request)

# 2. You call YOUR model - OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama, local, anything
ai_output = await your_model(request.input_text)

# 3. AIRS checks the output
output_result = await pipeline.evaluate_output(request, response)
```

AIRS only sees the text going in and the text coming out. It doesn't know or care which model you're using, how you're calling it, or what framework it runs on. This means it works with:

- **Any model provider**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Cohere, local models
- **Any framework**: LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, raw API calls
- **Any architecture**: single model, RAG, agents, multi-agent orchestration

The one exception is the optional **LLM-as-Judge**, which does call an OpenAI-compatible API to *evaluate* outputs. This is the judge model, a separate, independent model used for security evaluation, not your production model.

## What It Provides

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Guardrails** | Regex-based prompt injection detection, PII filtering, content policy (extensible) |
| **LLM-as-Judge** | Rule-based (no API key) or LLM-based (OpenAI-compatible) output evaluation |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Sliding-window failure tracking, auto-trip, manual emergency stop, recovery |
| **PACE Controller** | State machine for structured degradation (Primary → Alternate → Contingency → Emergency) |
| **Security Pipeline** | Orchestrates all layers with configurable behavior per PACE state |
| **Agent Security** | Identity propagation, delegation depth enforcement, cycle detection, scope narrowing |
| **Tool Policy Engine** | Tool-call → policy → allow/deny. Deny-list, allow-list, per-agent-type restrictions |
| **Telemetry & Audit** | Structured security events with correlation IDs, pluggable audit sinks for SOC integration |
| **CLI Assessment** | Interactive tool that classifies your deployment and recommends controls |
| **FastAPI Middleware** | Drop-in middleware that protects AI endpoints automatically |

## Install

```bash
pip install airs
```

That's it. You now have the core SDK (guardrails, circuit breaker, PACE, telemetry) and the `airs` CLI.

### Optional extras

```bash
# With FastAPI middleware
pip install "airs[fastapi]"

# With LLM-as-Judge (requires OpenAI-compatible API)
pip install "airs[judge]"

# Everything (includes all provider packages)
pip install "airs[all]"
```

### Model provider packages (BYOK)

To run `airs assess` with `--provider`, you need the provider's Python package installed. AIRS does not bundle these — **bring your own key, bring your own package**:

```bash
# For OpenAI models (gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, etc.)
pip install "airs[openai]"
# — or directly: pip install openai

# For Anthropic models (Claude Sonnet, Opus, Haiku, etc.)
pip install "airs[anthropic]"
# — or directly: pip install anthropic

# Both providers
pip install "airs[openai,anthropic]"
```

You also need an API key from your provider:

| Provider | Package | API Key Env Var | Get a Key |
|----------|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) |

Set your key for the session:

```bash
# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

Then run:

```bash
airs assess --provider openai --model gpt-4o
airs assess --provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

!!! warning "Missing provider package?"
    If you see `openai package not installed` or `anthropic package not installed`, install the relevant package above. The core `pip install airs` intentionally keeps these optional so you only install what you use.

### Verify it works

```bash
# Check version
airs version

# Run the interactive assessment
airs assess

# Machine-readable output
airs assess --json --non-interactive
```

!!! tip "No external dependencies for core"
    The core SDK (guardrails, circuit breaker, PACE) requires only `pydantic`, `rich`, and `typer`. No API keys or external services needed to get started.

??? note "Install from source"
    If you prefer to install from source:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JonathanCGill/airuntimesecurity.io.git
    cd airuntimesecurity.io
    pip install ".[all,dev]"
    ```

## 5-Minute Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from airs.core.models import AIRequest, AIResponse
from airs.runtime import (
    SecurityPipeline, GuardrailChain, RegexGuardrail,
    CircuitBreaker, PACEController,
)

async def main():
    # Build the pipeline
    pipeline = SecurityPipeline(
        guardrails=GuardrailChain([RegexGuardrail()]),
        circuit_breaker=CircuitBreaker(),
        pace=PACEController(),
    )

    # Evaluate input before calling your model
    request = AIRequest(input_text="What is the capital of France?")
    input_result = await pipeline.evaluate_input(request)

    if not input_result.allowed:
        print(f"Blocked: {input_result.blocked_by}")
        return

    # Call your AI model (replace with your actual model call)
    ai_output = "The capital of France is Paris."

    # Evaluate output before returning to user
    response = AIResponse(request_id=request.request_id, output_text=ai_output)
    output_result = await pipeline.evaluate_output(request, response)

    if output_result.allowed:
        print(ai_output)
    else:
        print(f"Response blocked: {output_result.blocked_by}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Model Integration

The SDK is model-agnostic — it wraps security controls around your existing model calls. The quick start above uses a hardcoded string in place of a real model. To test against a live model, use the CLI:

```bash
# Test against OpenAI
airs assess --provider openai --model gpt-4o --non-interactive

# Test against Anthropic
airs assess --provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --non-interactive
```

This sends test prompts through the full AIRS pipeline against a live model and shows what gets blocked. See [Live model testing](#live-model-testing-optional) below for details on API keys and costs.

## CLI Assessment

Classify your deployment and get a prioritized implementation plan:

```bash
airs assess
```

The tool asks about your deployment context (audience, data sensitivity, autonomy, architecture) and outputs:

- **Risk tier** (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL)
- **Risk factors and mitigations** specific to your deployment
- **PACE resilience posture**: what happens at each degradation level
- **Prioritized control list**: what to implement first
- **Code snippet** to get started

For machine-readable output:

```bash
airs assess --json
```

### Live model testing (optional)

You can also run the assessment against a live AI model. This sends test prompts (clean questions + injection/jailbreak attempts) through the full AIRS security pipeline and shows what gets blocked and what gets through.

```bash
# Test against OpenAI
airs assess --provider openai --model gpt-4o --non-interactive --json

# Test against Anthropic
airs assess --provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --non-interactive --json

# Omit --model to use the default for each provider
airs assess --provider openai --non-interactive
```

**No API key? No problem.** The assessment works perfectly without `--provider`. Live model testing is entirely optional — it just adds a real-world demo of the guardrails in action.

!!! info "Prerequisites for live testing"
    Live model testing requires two things:

    1. **The provider's Python package** — see [Model provider packages (BYOK)](#model-provider-packages-byok) above
    2. **An API key** — if the key isn't set as an environment variable, `airs assess` will prompt you to paste it

    **Quick setup:**

    ```bash
    # OpenAI
    pip install "airs[openai]"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

    # Anthropic
    pip install "airs[anthropic]"
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
    ```

    **Costs:** Each live test run makes a small number of API calls (4 short prompts). This typically costs a few cents on your account. No calls are made unless you explicitly use `--provider`.
